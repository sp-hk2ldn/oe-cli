# Apple Ads Certification Findings (Extracted)

Source extraction: `/Users/stephenparker/workspace/keyword-research/AGENTS.md`, section "Apple Ads Certification Findings (Observed 2026-01-31)".

## Observed guidance
- Use keyword themes across Brand, Category, Competitor, and Discovery.
- Use exact match in Brand/Category/Competitor ad groups.
- Use broad + Search Match for Discovery-oriented keyword mining.
- Keep Search Match configuration at ad-group level and use it intentionally for discovery.
- Use keyword suggestions as a seed source, then promote terms based on performance.
- Add exact-match negatives in discovery ad groups for promoted terms to reduce overlap.
- For search results ad variations, approved custom product pages can be selected; one active variation per ad group.
- Default search results ad behavior applies when variation is unavailable (for example, unsupported iOS or variation on hold).
- Reporting and optimization rely on campaign/ad-group/keyword/ad dashboards, custom reports, and impression share/rank recommendations.

## Performance and attribution
- Analyze taps, spend, CPT, installs, conversion rate, and CPA.
- Use tap-through and view-through installs correctly when interpreting impact.
- Use Attribution API/MMP signals where available to connect performance to value.

## Inferred working policy
- Discovery is a term-mining pipeline.
- Promotion should be threshold-based (quality + efficiency).
- Isolation should be enforced through exact-match negatives in discovery.
