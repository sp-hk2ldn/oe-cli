# Apple Ads Certification Core

## Use when
- A user asks for Apple Ads strategy aligned with certification guidance.
- A user wants campaign/account structure recommendations for search results campaigns.
- A user wants to understand how to use Search Match, exact/broad/negative keywords, and keyword suggestions in a certification-consistent way.

## Workflow
1. Confirm goal and campaign type (new setup, restructure, or optimization review).
2. Use certification-aligned structure:
   - Separate Brand, Category, Competitor, and Discovery campaigns.
   - Keep Search Match focused on Discovery ad groups.
3. Validate keyword/match-type setup against the checklist in `references/certification-findings.md`.
4. Recommend concrete next actions with measurable thresholds.
5. Clearly label observed guidance vs working-policy inference.

## Guardrails
- Do not claim unsupported Apple Ads API endpoints.
- Prefer observed certification guidance; mark inferred automation policy as inferred.
- Keep recommendations region-sensitive for Search Match and localization constraints.

## References
- Read `references/certification-findings.md` for extracted observed findings and inferred policy notes.
