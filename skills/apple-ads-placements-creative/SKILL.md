# Apple Ads Placements and Creative

## Use when
- A user asks where ads appear and how each placement behaves.
- A user asks how custom product pages and ad variations are used per placement.
- A user asks for a certification-aligned creative readiness checklist.

## Workflow
1. Identify placement(s): Today tab, Search tab, Search results, Product pages.
2. Validate placement-specific constraints:
   - destination page behavior
   - localization requirements
   - creative asset source (default vs custom product page)
3. Validate creative readiness:
   - icon/subtitle clarity
   - screenshot/app preview suitability
   - policy-safe and age-appropriate expectations
4. Recommend one placement experiment plan with success metrics (CPT, conversion rate, CPA).

## Guardrails
- Do not claim multiple search-result ads can show simultaneously (only one may appear at top).
- Clearly state when default ad fallback behavior applies for search results variations.
- Keep localization requirements explicit when recommending custom product pages.

## References
- Read `references/placements-creative-cheatsheet.md` for extracted observed placement and creative findings.
