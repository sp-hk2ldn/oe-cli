# Operational SOP: Discovery -> Promotion -> Isolation

## Cadence and window
- Cadence: weekly (or twice weekly).
- Lookback: 14 days.
- Exclude newest 24-48 hours for attribution lag.

## Inputs
- Discovery Search Terms report (Search Match + Broad ad groups).
- Keyword/ad-group metrics: taps, spend, CPT, installs.
- Attribution signals (AdServices/MMP where available).
- Config: target CPA, campaign IDs, brand/competitor lists.

## Promotion defaults
- `min_taps >= 10`
- `min_installs >= 2`
- `CPA <= target_CPA`
- `TTR >= discovery_median`

## Actions
1. Add qualifying terms to Brand/Category/Competitor as exact-match keywords.
2. Set initial bid to recommended low range (or recent CPT +10% if no recommendation).
3. Add same terms as exact-match negatives in Discovery ad groups.

## Review policy
- After 7 days, pause/negate promoted terms that fail tap/install/CPA thresholds.
- Raise bids or create tailored custom product pages when terms perform strongly.

## Explainability requirements
- Save per-term reason codes:
  - promoted_by_thresholds
  - skipped_low_volume
  - skipped_high_cpa
  - skipped_already_targeted
- Store snapshot reference for every decision.
