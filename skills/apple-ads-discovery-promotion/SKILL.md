# Discovery -> Promotion -> Isolation

## Use when
- A user asks for weekly keyword optimization workflow.
- A user asks how to promote search terms from discovery campaigns.
- A user wants an automation spec for safe keyword expansion and isolation.

## Workflow
1. Pull Discovery search term and keyword/ad-group performance data for the configured window.
2. Normalize and dedupe terms; exclude terms already added as exact keywords or negatives.
3. Score terms by promotion thresholds (taps, installs, CPA, TTR).
4. Classify winners into Brand/Category/Competitor targets.
5. Promote winners as exact-match keywords in target ad groups.
6. Add promoted terms as exact-match negatives in Discovery ad groups.
7. Emit audit logs and reasons per term (why promoted/skipped).

## Default policy
- Weekly cadence (or twice weekly).
- 14-day lookback.
- Exclude most recent 24-48 hours for lag.
- Dry-run by default.
- Cap number of new keywords per run.
- No deletes or budget changes in the same run.

## Guardrails
- No destructive changes without explicit user confirmation.
- Do not remove discovery coverage before replacement exact terms are active.
- Keep Search Match isolation behavior explicit in output recommendations.

- Read `references/discovery-promotion-sop.md` for thresholds and automation spec fields.
