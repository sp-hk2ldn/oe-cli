### How to use skills
- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this repo.
- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) or the task clearly matches a skill description, use that skill.
- Progressive disclosure:
  1. Open the skill `SKILL.md` first.
  2. Load only the specific `references/` files needed for the current task.
  3. Avoid bulk-loading all reference files.
- Keep context lean: summarize long references; only pull detailed sections needed to complete the task.
